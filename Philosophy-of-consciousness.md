Philosophy of Consciousness

Finite Eyes of an Infinite Self by Marissa Vasquez

Imagine I ask you to look deeply into your own eyes. To do this, you must first find a mirror. But what if you had no access to a mirror—or to any kind of reflection at all? Imagine yourself sitting alone in a field, tasked with the impossible: to observe your own eyes directly. Without a reflective surface, the task becomes unimaginable. You could never truly know your own face. As a result, we could not even fathom the idea of “eyes”; we would not know we had eyes, nor would we understand the concept that is vision. 
This thought experiment is complex in many ways, and to me, it proposes a philosophy of perceived consciousness that is not so easily understood. This experiment reveals something profound. It is not merely about mirrors; it is about self-awareness. To observe oneself requires separation—a distance between the observer and the observed. Without that separation, self-knowledge becomes impossible. This, I believe, points to a deeper understanding of consciousness itself.
As human beings, we have the highest and most complex understanding of consciousness. We understand that we exist and can form conclusions based on evidence, to answer questions about how we exist, where we exist, and even analyze the existence of others. To our current knowledge, human beings have existed for at least 300,000 years, and it's commonly understood and accepted that we have had consciousness for about 200,000 of those years. It is amazing how far we have come in the development of science. So many of life's mysteries have become clear in the light of our human minds. Through trial and error, exploration, and thoughtfulness, we humans have evolved our consciousness to a level far beyond our original construction.
Returning to our thought experiment, the reflective surface of a mirror allows us to perceive something otherwise hidden: ourselves. The mirror works by reflecting light equal to the angle at which it arrives. This principle of physics gives us a beautiful gift—the ability to see ourselves, to encounter our own being not just as a subject, but as an object of perception. Without it, we lack vital information about our existence. I could still touch my face with my hands, but without sight, I would never fully understand what I was touching. I would lack awareness of the truth of my face.
Humans can not feel all the things that are seen; nor can we smell all that we can hear, or see all that we can smell. Our senses work together to create our totality. Without any one of our senses, we would have an incomplete knowledge of reality. Even with all of the human senses an individual may have, we still rely on each other. Human evolution is not merely biological—it is also intellectual, philosophical, and communal. No individual becomes conscious in isolation. A single life is defined not by the individual alone, but by the individual and all that came before them. For without the knowledge defined by our past, we know no future.
This leads me to my central idea: I am not merely a part of the universe—I am the universe. And at the same time, I am a distinct, finite being within it. I exist in paradox: both whole and fragment, both infinite and finite.
Just as a single molecule of H₂O is not the same as a glass of water, a single consciousness is not the whole, but it is made of the same substance. A single water molecule contains no “wetness” on its own, yet trillions together create the substance we know as water. Likewise, I am made of the same material as you, as the stars, as all living things. I am the universe, expressing itself through the limitations of a finite mind.
But here’s the key: in order to experience itself, the infinite must become limited. Just as it is impossible to see your own eyes without a mirror, it is impossible for the universe to reflect upon itself without separation. Consciousness arises only when something stands apart from the whole, long enough to observe it.
If I were infinite in form and awareness, I would be everything, everywhere, all at once, and therefore nothing in particular. I would have no point of view. No “self.” I would not experience anything because I would be everything. Thus, to become conscious, I must be finite. I must be a reflection. A mirror image of something vaster.
I propose, then, that human beings are pieces of the universe that have temporarily separated from the whole in order to perceive it. The universe has split itself—not broken, but reflected—so that it might look into its own eyes. We are the mirrors of harmony, each of us holding just enough distance from the whole to see it, and to see ourselves. Consciousness is not a byproduct of life; it is the universe catching its own reflection.
